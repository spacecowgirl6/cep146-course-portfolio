## Tools I Use
- ***OneNote by Microsoft:*** Good for taking and organizing notes.
  You can create 'notebooks' and have as many sections as you want.
  Within these sections you can create new documents which essentially become
  your notebook 'pages'. It also allows you to import videos, pdf's, audios,
  screen clippings, and many more external items to your notebook page.
  
- ***Chrome by Google:*** Good for research, has a lot of options for add-ons and
  is very easy to customize. You can also group tabs and bookmarks.
  
- ***Outlining and Mapping:*** Outlining concepts makes notes organized, and mapping
  out further details helps to visualize and conect information learned. I also
  colour code and use tables extensivly.
